The Infinity Saga
Phase 1-3

## User Story

As a user navigates to our website they're presented with a list of marvel movies from The Infinity Saga Phases 1-3 in chronological order.
When the user clicks a movie thumbnail, they are presented with the rotten tomatoes rating and a trailer of that movie.
When user clicks anywhere outside of the video container, the video goes away. There is also a nav bar that jumps you to each phase on the page.
They can also "like" favorite movies by clickin the heart icons beside each movie.

## Tech Used
For this project we used two APIs Youtube and IMDB for the movie trailers and the ratings for each movie
We also used uikit for the css framework and SweetAlert2 for the modal
